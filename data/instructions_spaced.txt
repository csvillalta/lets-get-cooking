Build yourbarbecue so that there is a higher pile ofcoals on one side and a lower pile on theother.
Light the barbecue and, whenthe coals are ashen, grill the vegetables(be careful that the asparagus andspring onions do not fall through thebars) until lightly charred and wilted.
Scoop them into a dish and dress withthe rest of the olive oil and the lemonjuice, then scatter with the fennel frondsand sliced spring onions, and set aside.
Now cook the pork.
It needs to sizzlefor 1 hr over a fairly low heat – the coalsshould be grey but, to ensure they don’tgo out halfway through cooking, you mayneed to keep adding occasional coals.
Lay the pork on the coolest side of thebarbecue, fat-side down, and brown forabout 20 mins until well charred (if youhave a kettle barbecue, cover with thelid).
Use tongs to flip the meat andcontinue to cook slowly for about 1 hrmore, turning and moving the meatoccasionally, until the thickest part is veryfirm when prodded, or when the juicesshow no sign of pink when pierced witha skewer.
If you have a digital cookingthermometer, it should read 65C or morewhen inserted in the thickest part.
(If thepork is organic, it’s fine if it’s a tiny bitpink, but you certainly don’t want it raw.
)When the pork is cooked, place on adish, scatter with parsley, drizzle overthe rest of the vinegar and leave to restsomewhere warm for 15 mins.
Carvethe pork into thin slices on a board andserve with the just warm vegetablesand vinegary resting juices.

Meanwhile, melt down the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring each time until smooth.
Allow to cool for a minute.
Place sparkly sugar in a dish.
Using a fork, drop a truffle in the chocolate and roll over to coat entirely.
Gently lift out the truffle and balance the fork on the edge of the measuring cup so the chocolate can drip off and set just a little.
Drop in the sugar and use a spoon to scoop the sprinkles all over the truffle.
Gently lift with the spoon to the baking sheet to set.
Repeat until all truffles are used.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge or very cool place.
Eat within a day and do not allow them to gather condensation or they will sweat the black dye.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan, and cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat (stirring regularly) for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.

Crumble in the stock cube, and add around 500ml hot water to begin with.
Mix well, and leave to simmer gently.
When the water has nearly all been absorbed, add a little more, and continue doing this until the rice is just short of being completely cooked.
At this stage, stir continually while the last bit of water is absorbed (make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan - you might want to turn the heat down to low).
The mixture should be very moist, but with no excess water in the bottom of the pan.
Add the chopped spinach and grated cheese, and season very generously with black pepper (this is key!).
If you used low-sodium stock, you might also need to add a little salt.
Mix well, and continue to stir for a couple more minutes while the spinach wilts and the cheese melts, then serve.

Add the orzo, stirring it so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.
Cook, uncovered, at a high boil until al dente, cooked through but still a bit firm.
Drain the pasta (it helps to use a fine mesh sieve for this as the small orzo might pass through holes in a colander), and rinse with cold water to stop the pasta from cooking further.
2 Toss the pasta with the olive oil in a large bowl.
At this point you can make ahead and chill until you are ready to serve (or transport to a party).
Toss with the rest of the ingredients, the tomatoes, feta cheese, cucumber, green onions, oregano, lemon juice, and black pepper.

Combine remaining 1/4 cup cilantro with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, mango, avocado, tomato, onion, jalapeño and lime juice in a bowl.
Carefully open foil; stir contents; garnish with salsa before serving.
* You could use any spice you have in your pantry if you do not have Badia Tropical Sazon.
Garlic, coriander, jerk season, etc.
They would all be delicious.
You could also leave out the seasoning and the packet would still be full of flavor from the fresh salsa.

Using a pestle and mortar, bashand bruise the bay, rosemary andthyme with the garlic, olive oil and1 tbsp of the vinegar, plus someseasoning.
Smear the mixture allover the meat to marinate.
Can bedone up to 24 hrs ahead.
Set aside the fennel fronds andsliced spring onions, and toss the restof the vegetables in 1 tbsp of the oliveoil and some seasoning.
Build yourbarbecue so that there is a higher pile ofcoals on one side and a lower pile on theother.
Light the barbecue and, whenthe coals are ashen, grill the vegetables(be careful that the asparagus andspring onions do not fall through thebars) until lightly charred and wilted.
Scoop them into a dish and dress withthe rest of the olive oil and the lemonjuice, then scatter with the fennel frondsand sliced spring onions, and set aside.
Now cook the pork.
It needs to sizzlefor 1 hr over a fairly low heat – the coalsshould be grey but, to ensure they don’tgo out halfway through cooking, you mayneed to keep adding occasional coals.
Lay the pork on the coolest side of thebarbecue, fat-side down, and brown forabout 20 mins until well charred (if youhave a kettle barbecue, cover with thelid).
Use tongs to flip the meat andcontinue to cook slowly for about 1 hrmore, turning and moving the meatoccasionally, until the thickest part is veryfirm when prodded, or when the juicesshow no sign of pink when pierced witha skewer.
If you have a digital cookingthermometer, it should read 65C or morewhen inserted in the thickest part.
(If thepork is organic, it’s fine if it’s a tiny bitpink, but you certainly don’t want it raw.
)When the pork is cooked, place on adish, scatter with parsley, drizzle overthe rest of the vinegar and leave to restsomewhere warm for 15 mins.
Carvethe pork into thin slices on a board andserve with the just warm vegetablesand vinegary resting juices.

In a small bowl, combine topping ingredients of cup sugar and cinnamon.
Roll the balls in the topping mixture until completely coated.
Bake: Place balls 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.
Bake 10 to 11 minutes.
Tops of cookies should be puffed up and still soft in the middle.
Remove cookies from baking sheets with a metal spatula and place on a wire cooling rack to cool.
The cookies will flatten out as they cool.

In a food processor, add the oreos and process until they are completely broken down.
Add the cream cheese and process until smooth.
Scoop into a bowl and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet.
Scoop rounded tablespoons of the dough into your hands, and roll gently into clumps.
Don't worry about getting them perfectly round as the more clumpy the more like real coal.
Meanwhile, melt down the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring each time until smooth.
Allow to cool for a minute.
Place sparkly sugar in a dish.
Using a fork, drop a truffle in the chocolate and roll over to coat entirely.
Gently lift out the truffle and balance the fork on the edge of the measuring cup so the chocolate can drip off and set just a little.
Drop in the sugar and use a spoon to scoop the sprinkles all over the truffle.
Gently lift with the spoon to the baking sheet to set.
Repeat until all truffles are used.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge or very cool place.
Eat within a day and do not allow them to gather condensation or they will sweat the black dye.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan, and cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat (stirring regularly) for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.
Add the rice, and cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring continually.
Crumble in the stock cube, and add around 500ml hot water to begin with.
Mix well, and leave to simmer gently.
When the water has nearly all been absorbed, add a little more, and continue doing this until the rice is just short of being completely cooked.
At this stage, stir continually while the last bit of water is absorbed (make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan - you might want to turn the heat down to low).
The mixture should be very moist, but with no excess water in the bottom of the pan.
Add the chopped spinach and grated cheese, and season very generously with black pepper (this is key!).
If you used low-sodium stock, you might also need to add a little salt.
Mix well, and continue to stir for a couple more minutes while the spinach wilts and the cheese melts, then serve.

Gradually blend in dry ingredients.
Add just enough of the buttermilk to moisten the dough and make it soft, not wet.
The dough will be soft.
I only use about 2 tablespoons.
Roll small tablespoons of dough into balls and place on the cookie sheet.
With a brush or fingers, moisten the top of each cookie with the remaining buttermilk and slightly flatten the top of each cookie.
Sprinkle with raw sugar or colored sprinkles if desired.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until barely golden.
Let cookies cool on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack.
Mix all ingredients together well adding milk to desired consistency.
Place in a ziploc bag and snip of the corner.
Add a drizzle of frosting on top and sprinkles if desired.

Warm up your griddle, iron skillet or frying pan.
They need to be hot but not smokin' hot.
Place sour cream in a medium bowl.
Combine dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, & salt) in a sifter and sift over sour cream (or mix dry ingredients together in another bowl then add to sour cream).
Very gently, stir ingredients till they are mixed together, but not completely combined.
It's best to have the batter with a little bit of lumpy texture.
In separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, then add vanilla and stir mixture well.
Pour egg mixture into sour cream/flour mixture.
Stir gently until all ingredients are mixed well.
Melt about a tablespoon of butter onto skillet/pan/griddle.
Pour about 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto the pan.

Divide the the moist cookie dough and press into two disks; wrap both in plastic.
Chill for at least an hour or up to 3 days.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (F).
Lightly grease or spray two baking sheets.
Remove one disk of cookie dough from the fridge, unwrap it and place on a work surface dusted with flour.
Flatten the dough with your hands until it is about 1/2 inch thick.
Flip the dough over a few times until both side are dusted with flour, add more flour to the counter.
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it is 1/8 inch thick.
Move the dough around frequently to make sure it’s not sticking.
If it is, slide a pastry scraper under the dough and add more flour to the counter or dough.
Use a sharp floured knife to cut the dough into 5-by-2 1/2-inch rectangles or use a cookie cutter to cut into whatever shape you like.
Transfer to the baking sheet, about an inch apart (they spread out a bit, but not much).
To make them look like real graham crackers, slice the rectangles in half length and cross-wise, but do not separate the pieces.
Use a fork to press holes into the surface of the cookies.
Stir the sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle each rectangles with a few pinches of the mixture.
Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, turning the pans 180 degrees halfway through.
They are ready when the edge is a darker shade of brown than the rest of the cookie.
Remove from the oven and cool completely on a rack so the grahams become crisp.
(If the cookies are not quite crisp enough, next time they either need to bake longer or be rolled out thinner.
)Repeat steps 5 through 8 with the other half of the dough.

Wash the ribs and soak in clean water for around 10 minutes.
Boiling some water in a pot; put the ribs into cook for 1 to 2 minutes.

Line a 8 x 8 pan with 12 cookies; set a side.
(If all the cookies don't fit, just break them into large pieces)In a bowl beat cream cheese until light and fluffy.
Beat in pudding, until combined.
Beat in half the whip cream, until combined.
Fold in whip cream.
Add half the cream cheese mixture over cookies in the baking pan.
Top with sliced bananas and top with remaining cream cheese mixture.
In a mini food processor, add 4 cookies and process until crumbs.
Sprinkle crumbs over cream cheese mixture and top with maraschino cherries if desired (The cherries really give it a nice pop).
Refrigerate until ready to eat.
The longer it sits in the refrigerator the softer the cookies get.

Preheat oven to 350°.
Spray a 12 count muffin tin with cooking spray.
Open and gently roll out the french bread loaf onto a slightly floured surface.
Don't worry if it tears in places, you can pinch the dough back together.
Spoon out Nutella and spread evenly over the dough.
Roll the dough lengthwise from one end to the other.
Using a sharp serrated knife slice into 12 equal pieces.
Place them each into a muffin tin and bake for 10 minutes or until very slightly browned.
Drizzle with glaze and serve.
In a medium bowl mix the powdered sugar and milk until it is fully incorporated.
Drizzle over the rolls once they come out of the oven.

Line a 9 X 9 square baking pan with foil or parchment paper.
Generously butter the paper.
Preheat the oven to 325F.
Follow the preparation instructions for the Chewy Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, replacing the 1 Tablespoon of vanilla with 1 teaspoon peppermint extract + 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Stir in the Andes Crushed Peppermint Chips with the chocolate chips.
Press the cookie dough into the prepared pan.
Cover the cookie dough with a single layer of Peppermint Oreo Cookies (16 for an 8 X 8 pan; 20 for a 9 X 9)Prepare the brownie batter and pour it over the top.
Bake for 30-35 minutes.
COOL COMPLETELY.
Lift the foil or parchment from the pan, peel away from the edges, and slice with a good sharp knife.
For pretty layered slices you might want to rinse the knife in hot water between cuts.

Preheat oven to 225F and line a large cookie sheet (or two regular-sized cookie sheets -- make sure they will fit in your oven together) with parchment paper.
Set aside.
Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a large, completely clean, completely grease-free bowl.
Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with either the whisk or paddle attachment), stir on low speed until mixture becomes foamy.
Increase speed to high.
Gradually add sugar, about 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition).
Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume.
Mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved.
Stir in vanilla extract and peppermint extract.
Fit a large disposable piping bag with a large tip (I used Ateco 846, but any large star tip will work, or you can just snip the edge of the piping bag for a kiss formation) and use a clean paintbrush to paint the inside of the piping bag with stripes of red food dye (running the length of the piping bag).
Transfer meringue to prepared piping bag and pipe onto prepared cookie sheet.
The meringue cookies can be pretty close to each other as they wont spread, and you will want to bake all of the cookies at the same time, so keeping them close together will ensure that you have enough space.
Bake on 225F for 1 hour.
Turn off the oven once the baking time has passed, and do not open the oven door.
Leave the oven door closed and allow cookies to cool completely in the oven (1-2 hours) before removing.
Once cookies have cooled, melt dark chocolate melting wafers according to package instructions.
Dip the bottoms of the meringues in the dark chocolate and sprinkle with peppermint pieces.
Place meringues on their side on a piece of wax paper and allow chocolate to harden before enjoying.

Directions In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
Beat in egg.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition.
Fold in rhubarb.
Fill paper-lined or greased muffin cups three-fourths full.
For topping, combine the pecans, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; cut in butter until crumbly.
Sprinkle over batter.
Bake at 350° for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
Serve warm.
Yield: about 1-1/2 dozen.
Editor's Note: If using frozen rhubarb, measure rhubarb while still frozen, then thaw completely.
Drain in a colander, but do not press liquid out.

1 Bring a large pot of well salted water to a rolling boil.
Add the orzo, stirring it so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.
Cook, uncovered, at a high boil until al dente, cooked through but still a bit firm.
Drain the pasta (it helps to use a fine mesh sieve for this as the small orzo might pass through holes in a colander), and rinse with cold water to stop the pasta from cooking further.
2 Toss the pasta with the olive oil in a large bowl.
At this point you can make ahead and chill until you are ready to serve (or transport to a party).
Toss with the rest of the ingredients, the tomatoes, feta cheese, cucumber, green onions, oregano, lemon juice, and black pepper.
The feta is salty so you shouldn't need to add more salt.

Set aside the fennel fronds andsliced spring onions, and toss the restof the vegetables in 1 tbsp of the oliveoil and some seasoning.
Build yourbarbecue so that there is a higher pile ofcoals on one side and a lower pile on theother.
Light the barbecue and, whenthe coals are ashen, grill the vegetables(be careful that the asparagus andspring onions do not fall through thebars) until lightly charred and wilted.
Scoop them into a dish and dress withthe rest of the olive oil and the lemonjuice, then scatter with the fennel frondsand sliced spring onions, and set aside.
Now cook the pork.
It needs to sizzlefor 1 hr over a fairly low heat – the coalsshould be grey but, to ensure they don’tgo out halfway through cooking, you mayneed to keep adding occasional coals.
Lay the pork on the coolest side of thebarbecue, fat-side down, and brown forabout 20 mins until well charred (if youhave a kettle barbecue, cover with thelid).
Use tongs to flip the meat andcontinue to cook slowly for about 1 hrmore, turning and moving the meatoccasionally, until the thickest part is veryfirm when prodded, or when the juicesshow no sign of pink when pierced witha skewer.
If you have a digital cookingthermometer, it should read 65C or morewhen inserted in the thickest part.
(If thepork is organic, it’s fine if it’s a tiny bitpink, but you certainly don’t want it raw.
)When the pork is cooked, place on adish, scatter with parsley, drizzle overthe rest of the vinegar and leave to restsomewhere warm for 15 mins.
Carvethe pork into thin slices on a board andserve with the just warm vegetablesand vinegary resting juices.

Add the cream cheese and process until smooth.
Scoop into a bowl and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet.
Scoop rounded tablespoons of the dough into your hands, and roll gently into clumps.
Don't worry about getting them perfectly round as the more clumpy the more like real coal.
Meanwhile, melt down the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring each time until smooth.
Allow to cool for a minute.
Place sparkly sugar in a dish.
Using a fork, drop a truffle in the chocolate and roll over to coat entirely.
Gently lift out the truffle and balance the fork on the edge of the measuring cup so the chocolate can drip off and set just a little.
Drop in the sugar and use a spoon to scoop the sprinkles all over the truffle.
Gently lift with the spoon to the baking sheet to set.
Repeat until all truffles are used.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge or very cool place.
Eat within a day and do not allow them to gather condensation or they will sweat the black dye.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan, and cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat (stirring regularly) for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.

Crumble in the stock cube, and add around 500ml hot water to begin with.
Mix well, and leave to simmer gently.
When the water has nearly all been absorbed, add a little more, and continue doing this until the rice is just short of being completely cooked.
At this stage, stir continually while the last bit of water is absorbed (make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan - you might want to turn the heat down to low).
The mixture should be very moist, but with no excess water in the bottom of the pan.
Add the chopped spinach and grated cheese, and season very generously with black pepper (this is key!).
If you used low-sodium stock, you might also need to add a little salt.
Mix well, and continue to stir for a couple more minutes while the spinach wilts and the cheese melts, then serve.

Line a 8 x 8 pan with 12 cookies; set a side.
(If all the cookies don't fit, just break them into large pieces)In a bowl beat cream cheese until light and fluffy.
Beat in pudding, until combined.
Beat in half the whip cream, until combined.
Fold in whip cream.
Add half the cream cheese mixture over cookies in the baking pan.
Top with sliced bananas and top with remaining cream cheese mixture.
In a mini food processor, add 4 cookies and process until crumbs.
Sprinkle crumbs over cream cheese mixture and top with maraschino cherries if desired (The cherries really give it a nice pop).
Refrigerate until ready to eat.
The longer it sits in the refrigerator the softer the cookies get.

Preheat oven to 350°.
Spray a 12 count muffin tin with cooking spray.
Open and gently roll out the french bread loaf onto a slightly floured surface.
Don't worry if it tears in places, you can pinch the dough back together.
Spoon out Nutella and spread evenly over the dough.
Roll the dough lengthwise from one end to the other.
Using a sharp serrated knife slice into 12 equal pieces.
Place them each into a muffin tin and bake for 10 minutes or until very slightly browned.
Drizzle with glaze and serve.
In a medium bowl mix the powdered sugar and milk until it is fully incorporated.
Drizzle over the rolls once they come out of the oven.

Line a 9 X 9 square baking pan with foil or parchment paper.
Generously butter the paper.
Preheat the oven to 325F.
Follow the preparation instructions for the Chewy Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, replacing the 1 Tablespoon of vanilla with 1 teaspoon peppermint extract + 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Stir in the Andes Crushed Peppermint Chips with the chocolate chips.
Press the cookie dough into the prepared pan.
Cover the cookie dough with a single layer of Peppermint Oreo Cookies (16 for an 8 X 8 pan; 20 for a 9 X 9)Prepare the brownie batter and pour it over the top.
Bake for 30-35 minutes.
COOL COMPLETELY.
Lift the foil or parchment from the pan, peel away from the edges, and slice with a good sharp knife.
For pretty layered slices you might want to rinse the knife in hot water between cuts.

Preheat oven to 225F and line a large cookie sheet (or two regular-sized cookie sheets -- make sure they will fit in your oven together) with parchment paper.
Set aside.
Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a large, completely clean, completely grease-free bowl.
Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with either the whisk or paddle attachment), stir on low speed until mixture becomes foamy.
Increase speed to high.
Gradually add sugar, about 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition).
Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume.
Mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved.
Stir in vanilla extract and peppermint extract.
Fit a large disposable piping bag with a large tip (I used Ateco 846, but any large star tip will work, or you can just snip the edge of the piping bag for a kiss formation) and use a clean paintbrush to paint the inside of the piping bag with stripes of red food dye (running the length of the piping bag).
Transfer meringue to prepared piping bag and pipe onto prepared cookie sheet.
The meringue cookies can be pretty close to each other as they wont spread, and you will want to bake all of the cookies at the same time, so keeping them close together will ensure that you have enough space.
Bake on 225F for 1 hour.
Turn off the oven once the baking time has passed, and do not open the oven door.
Leave the oven door closed and allow cookies to cool completely in the oven (1-2 hours) before removing.
Once cookies have cooled, melt dark chocolate melting wafers according to package instructions.
Dip the bottoms of the meringues in the dark chocolate and sprinkle with peppermint pieces.
Place meringues on their side on a piece of wax paper and allow chocolate to harden before enjoying.

Directions In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
Beat in egg.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition.
Fold in rhubarb.
Fill paper-lined or greased muffin cups three-fourths full.
For topping, combine the pecans, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; cut in butter until crumbly.
Sprinkle over batter.
Bake at 350° for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
Serve warm.
Yield: about 1-1/2 dozen.
Editor's Note: If using frozen rhubarb, measure rhubarb while still frozen, then thaw completely.
Drain in a colander, but do not press liquid out.

1 Bring a large pot of well salted water to a rolling boil.
Add the orzo, stirring it so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.
Cook, uncovered, at a high boil until al dente, cooked through but still a bit firm.
Drain the pasta (it helps to use a fine mesh sieve for this as the small orzo might pass through holes in a colander), and rinse with cold water to stop the pasta from cooking further.
2 Toss the pasta with the olive oil in a large bowl.
At this point you can make ahead and chill until you are ready to serve (or transport to a party).
Toss with the rest of the ingredients, the tomatoes, feta cheese, cucumber, green onions, oregano, lemon juice, and black pepper.
The feta is salty so you shouldn't need to add more salt.

Combine remaining 1/4 cup cilantro with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, mango, avocado, tomato, onion, jalapeño and lime juice in a bowl.
Carefully open foil; stir contents; garnish with salsa before serving.
* You could use any spice you have in your pantry if you do not have Badia Tropical Sazon.
Garlic, coriander, jerk season, etc.
They would all be delicious.
You could also leave out the seasoning and the packet would still be full of flavor from the fresh salsa.

Using a pestle and mortar, bashand bruise the bay, rosemary andthyme with the garlic, olive oil and1 tbsp of the vinegar, plus someseasoning.
Smear the mixture allover the meat to marinate.
Can bedone up to 24 hrs ahead.
Set aside the fennel fronds andsliced spring onions, and toss the restof the vegetables in 1 tbsp of the oliveoil and some seasoning.
Build yourbarbecue so that there is a higher pile ofcoals on one side and a lower pile on theother.
Light the barbecue and, whenthe coals are ashen, grill the vegetables(be careful that the asparagus andspring onions do not fall through thebars) until lightly charred and wilted.
Scoop them into a dish and dress withthe rest of the olive oil and the lemonjuice, then scatter with the fennel frondsand sliced spring onions, and set aside.
Now cook the pork.
It needs to sizzlefor 1 hr over a fairly low heat – the coalsshould be grey but, to ensure they don’tgo out halfway through cooking, you mayneed to keep adding occasional coals.
Lay the pork on the coolest side of thebarbecue, fat-side down, and brown forabout 20 mins until well charred (if youhave a kettle barbecue, cover with thelid).
Use tongs to flip the meat andcontinue to cook slowly for about 1 hrmore, turning and moving the meatoccasionally, until the thickest part is veryfirm when prodded, or when the juicesshow no sign of pink when pierced witha skewer.
If you have a digital cookingthermometer, it should read 65C or morewhen inserted in the thickest part.
(If thepork is organic, it’s fine if it’s a tiny bitpink, but you certainly don’t want it raw.
)When the pork is cooked, place on adish, scatter with parsley, drizzle overthe rest of the vinegar and leave to restsomewhere warm for 15 mins.
Carvethe pork into thin slices on a board andserve with the just warm vegetablesand vinegary resting juices.

In a small bowl, combine topping ingredients of cup sugar and cinnamon.
Roll the balls in the topping mixture until completely coated.
Bake: Place balls 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.
Bake 10 to 11 minutes.
Tops of cookies should be puffed up and still soft in the middle.
Remove cookies from baking sheets with a metal spatula and place on a wire cooling rack to cool.
The cookies will flatten out as they cool.

In a food processor, add the oreos and process until they are completely broken down.
Add the cream cheese and process until smooth.
Scoop into a bowl and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet.
Scoop rounded tablespoons of the dough into your hands, and roll gently into clumps.
Don't worry about getting them perfectly round as the more clumpy the more like real coal.
Meanwhile, melt down the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring each time until smooth.
Allow to cool for a minute.
Place sparkly sugar in a dish.
Using a fork, drop a truffle in the chocolate and roll over to coat entirely.
Gently lift out the truffle and balance the fork on the edge of the measuring cup so the chocolate can drip off and set just a little.
Drop in the sugar and use a spoon to scoop the sprinkles all over the truffle.
Gently lift with the spoon to the baking sheet to set.
Repeat until all truffles are used.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge or very cool place.
Eat within a day and do not allow them to gather condensation or they will sweat the black dye.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan, and cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat (stirring regularly) for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.
Add the rice, and cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring continually.
Crumble in the stock cube, and add around 500ml hot water to begin with.
Mix well, and leave to simmer gently.
When the water has nearly all been absorbed, add a little more, and continue doing this until the rice is just short of being completely cooked.
At this stage, stir continually while the last bit of water is absorbed (make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan - you might want to turn the heat down to low).
The mixture should be very moist, but with no excess water in the bottom of the pan.
Add the chopped spinach and grated cheese, and season very generously with black pepper (this is key!).
If you used low-sodium stock, you might also need to add a little salt.
Mix well, and continue to stir for a couple more minutes while the spinach wilts and the cheese melts, then serve.

Let cookies cool on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack.
Mix all ingredients together well adding milk to desired consistency.
Place in a ziploc bag and snip of the corner.
Add a drizzle of frosting on top and sprinkles if desired.

Warm up your griddle, iron skillet or frying pan.
They need to be hot but not smokin' hot.
Place sour cream in a medium bowl.
Combine dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, & salt) in a sifter and sift over sour cream (or mix dry ingredients together in another bowl then add to sour cream).
Very gently, stir ingredients till they are mixed together, but not completely combined.
It's best to have the batter with a little bit of lumpy texture.
In separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, then add vanilla and stir mixture well.
Pour egg mixture into sour cream/flour mixture.

Remove one disk of cookie dough from the fridge, unwrap it and place on a work surface dusted with flour.
Flatten the dough with your hands until it is about 1/2 inch thick.
Flip the dough over a few times until both side are dusted with flour, add more flour to the counter.
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it is 1/8 inch thick.
Move the dough around frequently to make sure it’s not sticking.
If it is, slide a pastry scraper under the dough and add more flour to the counter or dough.
Use a sharp floured knife to cut the dough into 5-by-2 1/2-inch rectangles or use a cookie cutter to cut into whatever shape you like.
Transfer to the baking sheet, about an inch apart (they spread out a bit, but not much).
To make them look like real graham crackers, slice the rectangles in half length and cross-wise, but do not separate the pieces.
Use a fork to press holes into the surface of the cookies.
Stir the sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle each rectangles with a few pinches of the mixture.
Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, turning the pans 180 degrees halfway through.
They are ready when the edge is a darker shade of brown than the rest of the cookie.
Remove from the oven and cool completely on a rack so the grahams become crisp.
(If the cookies are not quite crisp enough, next time they either need to bake longer or be rolled out thinner.
)Repeat steps 5 through 8 with the other half of the dough.

In a mini food processor, add 4 cookies and process until crumbs.
Sprinkle crumbs over cream cheese mixture and top with maraschino cherries if desired (The cherries really give it a nice pop).
Refrigerate until ready to eat.
The longer it sits in the refrigerator the softer the cookies get.

Preheat oven to 350°.
Spray a 12 count muffin tin with cooking spray.
Open and gently roll out the french bread loaf onto a slightly floured surface.
Don't worry if it tears in places, you can pinch the dough back together.
Spoon out Nutella and spread evenly over the dough.
Roll the dough lengthwise from one end to the other.
Using a sharp serrated knife slice into 12 equal pieces.
Place them each into a muffin tin and bake for 10 minutes or until very slightly browned.

Set aside.
Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a large, completely clean, completely grease-free bowl.
Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with either the whisk or paddle attachment), stir on low speed until mixture becomes foamy.
Increase speed to high.
Gradually add sugar, about 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition).
Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume.
Mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved.
Stir in vanilla extract and peppermint extract.
Fit a large disposable piping bag with a large tip (I used Ateco 846, but any large star tip will work, or you can just snip the edge of the piping bag for a kiss formation) and use a clean paintbrush to paint the inside of the piping bag with stripes of red food dye (running the length of the piping bag).
Transfer meringue to prepared piping bag and pipe onto prepared cookie sheet.
The meringue cookies can be pretty close to each other as they wont spread, and you will want to bake all of the cookies at the same time, so keeping them close together will ensure that you have enough space.
Bake on 225F for 1 hour.
Turn off the oven once the baking time has passed, and do not open the oven door.
Leave the oven door closed and allow cookies to cool completely in the oven (1-2 hours) before removing.
Once cookies have cooled, melt dark chocolate melting wafers according to package instructions.
Dip the bottoms of the meringues in the dark chocolate and sprinkle with peppermint pieces.
Place meringues on their side on a piece of wax paper and allow chocolate to harden before enjoying.

Divide shrimp evenly among packets, placing next to couscous.
Fold foil to close and crimp edges to seal; put onto cookie sheet and add to oven.
I cooked two packets at at time because my oven is small.
Cook until packets are fully puffed, 10 - 12 minutes.
Combine remaining 1/4 cup cilantro with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, mango, avocado, tomato, onion, jalapeño and lime juice in a bowl.
Carefully open foil; stir contents; garnish with salsa before serving.
* You could use any spice you have in your pantry if you do not have Badia Tropical Sazon.
Garlic, coriander, jerk season, etc.
They would all be delicious.
You could also leave out the seasoning and the packet would still be full of flavor from the fresh salsa.

Using a pestle and mortar, bashand bruise the bay, rosemary andthyme with the garlic, olive oil and1 tbsp of the vinegar, plus someseasoning.
Smear the mixture allover the meat to marinate.
Can bedone up to 24 hrs ahead.
Set aside the fennel fronds andsliced spring onions, and toss the restof the vegetables in 1 tbsp of the oliveoil and some seasoning.
Build yourbarbecue so that there is a higher pile ofcoals on one side and a lower pile on theother.
Light the barbecue and, whenthe coals are ashen, grill the vegetables(be careful that the asparagus andspring onions do not fall through thebars) until lightly charred and wilted.
Scoop them into a dish and dress withthe rest of the olive oil and the lemonjuice, then scatter with the fennel frondsand sliced spring onions, and set aside.
Now cook the pork.
It needs to sizzlefor 1 hr over a fairly low heat – the coalsshould be grey but, to ensure they don’tgo out halfway through cooking, you mayneed to keep adding occasional coals.
Lay the pork on the coolest side of thebarbecue, fat-side down, and brown forabout 20 mins until well charred (if youhave a kettle barbecue, cover with thelid).
Use tongs to flip the meat andcontinue to cook slowly for about 1 hrmore, turning and moving the meatoccasionally, until the thickest part is veryfirm when prodded, or when the juicesshow no sign of pink when pierced witha skewer.
If you have a digital cookingthermometer, it should read 65C or morewhen inserted in the thickest part.
(If thepork is organic, it’s fine if it’s a tiny bitpink, but you certainly don’t want it raw.
)When the pork is cooked, place on adish, scatter with parsley, drizzle overthe rest of the vinegar and leave to restsomewhere warm for 15 mins.
Carvethe pork into thin slices on a board andserve with the just warm vegetablesand vinegary resting juices.

Cook bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crisp.
Remove bacon from pan, reserving 2 teaspoons drippings in pan.

Stir in 1/8 teaspoon salt.
Ladle about 1 1/2 cups soup into each of 4 bowls; top each serving with about 2 tablespoons bacon, 1 tablespoon remaining onions, and 2 tablespoons cheese.

In a large bowl of an electric mixer, combine butter, shortening, and 1 cups sugar; cream together until mixture appears light and fluffy.
Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.
Add eggs; beat until thoroughly mixed.
Add flour, cream of tarter, baking soda, and salt; stir until mixed.
Shape dough into small balls, about 1 in diameter.
Tip: An ice cream scoop is ideal for making uniform-sized cookies.
In a small bowl, combine topping ingredients of cup sugar and cinnamon.
Roll the balls in the topping mixture until completely coated.
Bake: Place balls 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.
Bake 10 to 11 minutes.
Tops of cookies should be puffed up and still soft in the middle.
Remove cookies from baking sheets with a metal spatula and place on a wire cooling rack to cool.
The cookies will flatten out as they cool.

In a food processor, add the oreos and process until they are completely broken down.
Add the cream cheese and process until smooth.
Scoop into a bowl and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet.
Scoop rounded tablespoons of the dough into your hands, and roll gently into clumps.
Don't worry about getting them perfectly round as the more clumpy the more like real coal.
Meanwhile, melt down the chocolate in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring each time until smooth.
Allow to cool for a minute.
Place sparkly sugar in a dish.
Using a fork, drop a truffle in the chocolate and roll over to coat entirely.
Gently lift out the truffle and balance the fork on the edge of the measuring cup so the chocolate can drip off and set just a little.
Drop in the sugar and use a spoon to scoop the sprinkles all over the truffle.
Gently lift with the spoon to the baking sheet to set.
Repeat until all truffles are used.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge or very cool place.
Eat within a day and do not allow them to gather condensation or they will sweat the black dye.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan, and cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat (stirring regularly) for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent.
Add the rice, and cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring continually.
Crumble in the stock cube, and add around 500ml hot water to begin with.
Mix well, and leave to simmer gently.
When the water has nearly all been absorbed, add a little more, and continue doing this until the rice is just short of being completely cooked.
At this stage, stir continually while the last bit of water is absorbed (make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan - you might want to turn the heat down to low).
The mixture should be very moist, but with no excess water in the bottom of the pan.
Add the chopped spinach and grated cheese, and season very generously with black pepper (this is key!).
If you used low-sodium stock, you might also need to add a little salt.
Mix well, and continue to stir for a couple more minutes while the spinach wilts and the cheese melts, then serve.

Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it is 1/8 inch thick.
Move the dough around frequently to make sure it’s not sticking.
If it is, slide a pastry scraper under the dough and add more flour to the counter or dough.
Use a sharp floured knife to cut the dough into 5-by-2 1/2-inch rectangles or use a cookie cutter to cut into whatever shape you like.
Transfer to the baking sheet, about an inch apart (they spread out a bit, but not much).
To make them look like real graham crackers, slice the rectangles in half length and cross-wise, but do not separate the pieces.
Use a fork to press holes into the surface of the cookies.
Stir the sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle each rectangles with a few pinches of the mixture.
Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, turning the pans 180 degrees halfway through.
They are ready when the edge is a darker shade of brown than the rest of the cookie.
Remove from the oven and cool completely on a rack so the grahams become crisp.
(If the cookies are not quite crisp enough, next time they either need to bake longer or be rolled out thinner.
)Repeat steps 5 through 8 with the other half of the dough.

Line a 8 x 8 pan with 12 cookies; set a side.
(If all the cookies don't fit, just break them into large pieces)In a bowl beat cream cheese until light and fluffy.
Beat in pudding, until combined.
Beat in half the whip cream, until combined.
Fold in whip cream.
Add half the cream cheese mixture over cookies in the baking pan.
Top with sliced bananas and top with remaining cream cheese mixture.
In a mini food processor, add 4 cookies and process until crumbs.
Sprinkle crumbs over cream cheese mixture and top with maraschino cherries if desired (The cherries really give it a nice pop).
Refrigerate until ready to eat.
The longer it sits in the refrigerator the softer the cookies get.

Preheat oven to 350°.
Spray a 12 count muffin tin with cooking spray.
Open and gently roll out the french bread loaf onto a slightly floured surface.
Don't worry if it tears in places, you can pinch the dough back together.
Spoon out Nutella and spread evenly over the dough.
Roll the dough lengthwise from one end to the other.
Using a sharp serrated knife slice into 12 equal pieces.
Place them each into a muffin tin and bake for 10 minutes or until very slightly browned.
Drizzle with glaze and serve.
In a medium bowl mix the powdered sugar and milk until it is fully incorporated.
Drizzle over the rolls once they come out of the oven.

Line a 9 X 9 square baking pan with foil or parchment paper.
Generously butter the paper.
Preheat the oven to 325F.
Follow the preparation instructions for the Chewy Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, replacing the 1 Tablespoon of vanilla with 1 teaspoon peppermint extract + 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Stir in the Andes Crushed Peppermint Chips with the chocolate chips.
Press the cookie dough into the prepared pan.
Cover the cookie dough with a single layer of Peppermint Oreo Cookies (16 for an 8 X 8 pan; 20 for a 9 X 9)Prepare the brownie batter and pour it over the top.
Bake for 30-35 minutes.
COOL COMPLETELY.
Lift the foil or parchment from the pan, peel away from the edges, and slice with a good sharp knife.
For pretty layered slices you might want to rinse the knife in hot water between cuts.

Preheat oven to 225F and line a large cookie sheet (or two regular-sized cookie sheets -- make sure they will fit in your oven together) with parchment paper.
Set aside.
Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a large, completely clean, completely grease-free bowl.
Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with either the whisk or paddle attachment), stir on low speed until mixture becomes foamy.
Increase speed to high.
Gradually add sugar, about 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition).
Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume.
Mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved.
Stir in vanilla extract and peppermint extract.
Fit a large disposable piping bag with a large tip (I used Ateco 846, but any large star tip will work, or you can just snip the edge of the piping bag for a kiss formation) and use a clean paintbrush to paint the inside of the piping bag with stripes of red food dye (running the length of the piping bag).
Transfer meringue to prepared piping bag and pipe onto prepared cookie sheet.
The meringue cookies can be pretty close to each other as they wont spread, and you will want to bake all of the cookies at the same time, so keeping them close together will ensure that you have enough space.
Bake on 225F for 1 hour.
Turn off the oven once the baking time has passed, and do not open the oven door.
Leave the oven door closed and allow cookies to cool completely in the oven (1-2 hours) before removing.
Once cookies have cooled, melt dark chocolate melting wafers according to package instructions.
Dip the bottoms of the meringues in the dark chocolate and sprinkle with peppermint pieces.
Place meringues on their side on a piece of wax paper and allow chocolate to harden before enjoying.

Directions In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until light and fluffy.
Beat in egg.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition.
Fold in rhubarb.
Fill paper-lined or greased muffin cups three-fourths full.
For topping, combine the pecans, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; cut in butter until crumbly.
Sprinkle over batter.
Bake at 350° for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
Serve warm.
Yield: about 1-1/2 dozen.
Editor's Note: If using frozen rhubarb, measure rhubarb while still frozen, then thaw completely.
Drain in a colander, but do not press liquid out.

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
Line large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a large bowl (of a stand mixer or with a handheld electric mixer), beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar together until just combined, about 20 seconds.
Increase the mixer speed to medium and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 1 minute longer.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Add the egg and vanilla and beat on medium-low until well mixed, about 30 seconds.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl again.
Add the flour mixture and mix until barely incorporated, 10-20 seconds.
It's ok if there are a few dry spots.
Gradually add the oats and mix until well-combined, about 30 seconds to 1 minutes.
If needed, give the dough a final stir with a wooden spoon to ensure that no flour pockets remain and that the ingredients are evenly distributed.
Scoop out about 2 tablespoon-sized mounds of dough and roll them to form balls.
Place the cookies about 2 1/2-inches apart on the baking sheet(s) - about 8 cookies per sheet.
They will spread quite a bit.
Lightly press each cookie to about 3/4-inch thickness (I found after baking one sheet of these that I didn't need to press them at all so use your best cookie judgment).
Bake 1 sheet of cookies at a time until the cookies are golden brown, edges are crisp, and centers are still very slightly soft, 13 to 16 minutes.
Cooling the cookies completely on the baking sheet will yield crispier, more perfect cookies.

Bring a large bot of salted water to a boil, then add the sweet potatoes.
Simmer just until fork tender, about 10-15 minutes depending upon the size of your potato chunks.
Drain, gently and quickly rinse with cold water, then set aside.
Cook the bacon.
My favorite method is to bake it: preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.
Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with foil, then place an ovenproof baking rack on top.
Arrange the bacon in a single layer on the baking rack, then bake until crisp, about 15 minutes depending upon the thickness of your bacon.
Remove from the baking rack to a paper towel-lined plate.
Let cool, then crumble into a large bowl.
Add the celery and green onions.
Prepare the mustard dressing: In a small bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the jalapeo (or fresno chile), mustard, garlic, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Add the sweet potatoes to the bowl with the bacon, drizzle with the dressing, then toss gently to combine.
Taste and season with additional salt/pepper as desired.
Serve warm, chilled, or at room temperature.

In a mixing bowl, combine the cereal, butterscotch chips, pecans, flax, pumpkin seeds and mix well.
In another mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, maple syrup and coconut oil.
Pour into the cereal mixture and mix well.
Press into an 8x8 pan lined with parchment paper.
Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.
Allow to cool completely and then break up into pieces.

To Make The Pasta: Cook the pasta in a large stockpot of generously-salted water according to package instructions.
Reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water for later, then drain the remaining water, and set the pasta aside.
To Make The Sauce: Meanwhile, as the pasta water is heating, whisk together the eggs, milk, 1/3 cup cheese, plus a generous pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl until smooth.
Set aside.
To Make The Chorizo: At the same time that you add the pasta to the boiling water, add the chorizo to a large saut pan.
Saut over medium heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring and flipping occasionally.
Remove from heat, drain off excess grease, and leave the cooked chorizo in the pan.
Once the pasta is drained and ready to go, transfer it immediately (you want the pasta to still be very hot!) to the saut pan with the chorizo.
Then slowly pour the sauce mixture into the pasta, while tossing the pasta continually with a pair of tongs, until the pasta is evenly coated and the sauce is creamy and cooked.
(Its very important that you toss the pasta while the sauce is being added, otherwise the eggs can scramble.
) If you think that the sauce seems too thick, youre welcome to add in a bit of the reserved starchy pasta water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.
Serve immediately, garnished with extra Manchego and black pepper, if desired.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, stir together cake mix and pudding mix.
Add butter and eggs and beat, starting on low speed and increasing to medium speed until the mixture is combined.
Dough will be thick.
Split the dough in half.
Add blue coloring to half the dough and red coloring to the other half, stirring until a uniform color.
Place parchment paper on cookie sheets.
Roll about ½ inch size balls of dough and place them an inch apart on the cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 4-6 minutes.
Remove when edges are set and top is crackly.
Allow to cool on the pans for 5 minutes then remove and cool on cookie sheets.
Once cookies are cooled, spread a large spoonful of frosting onto a blue cookie then place a red cookie on half.
Squeeze together until the frosting reaches the edges.
Roll edges in sprinkles if desired.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
In a large bowl, whisk half-and-half, milk, goat cheese, garlic, flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Arrange potato slices in a single layer in a medium greased baking dish.
Pour 1/4 of the milk mixture over top, then layer potato slices and add another 1/4 of the milk mixture.
Repeat with remaining potato slices and milk mixture until you reach the top of the dish.
Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until potato gratin is tender and bubbly.
Enjoy!
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Set a baking rack on the baking sheet.
Put the bacon on the baking rack.
Bake for 30 minutes, carefully flipping halfway through, or until desired crispness is achieved.
Transfer cooked bacon to a paper towel lined plate to cool.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Rinse the baby spinach and shake lightly to remove some of the water.
Put the spinach and chives in the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until the spinach is wilted.
Remove cooked spinach and chives to a paper towel lined cutting board, removing as much moisture as possible.
Discard the paper towels.
Chop the spinach and chives roughly.
Stir the chopped spinach and chives into the lightly beaten eggs.
Return to the skillet and cook until the eggs are set.
Divide the cooked eggs into four portions.
If desired, spread pesto on the toasted bread, then put the bacon on one slice of bread and top it with one-fourth of the eggs.
Top the eggs with microgreens if using.
Complete the sandwich with the second slice of bread.
Serve with extra pesto on the side if desired.
(In my book you can never have enough pesto.
)
In large bowl whisk together coconut flour and baking soda; set aside.
In a separate medium bowl, mix together the nut butter, eggs, honey, banana and almond milk together until smooth and well combined.
Add wet ingredients to flour mixture and mix together.
Note: If you find that the batter is WAY too thick (almost paste like), you can add in a teaspoon or two of milk until it is smooth, but still THICK.
It will be like a thick brownie batter.
Lightly coat a large nonstick skillet or griddle with butter or coconut oil and place over medium low heat (coconut flour is sensitive to burning so medium-low heat is best).
Drop about 3 tablespoons of the batter onto the skillet; you may need to use a spoon to spread out the batter just a tiny bit.
It's important not to place more than 3 tablespoons of batter at a time; the pancakes can be hard to flip if they are too large, so smaller pancakes are best.
Plus mini pancakes are adorable, duh.
It's very important to cook until bubbles appear on top and the edges are well cooked.
Flip cakes and cook until golden brown on underside, 2 minutes.

Slowly add the milk while whisking and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens (it wont thicken fully until its almost at a boil), whisking often.
Add the hot sauce.

Stir in the lemon zest and season with kosher salt and fresh pepper.
Remove from heat to cool.
Once the sauce has thickened, remove from heat and slowly add the cheeses a handful at a time until its all incorporated, stirring with each addition.
If the cheese isn't melting, turn the burner on low and heat just until the cheese melts and becomes smooth with the sauce.

Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture on top of the pasta and bake for about 20 - 25 minutes, until the pasta is bubbly and lightly browned on top.
NOTE: You can make this up to a day ahead and refrigerate until ready to use.
It may need a few extra minutes in the oven to become bubbly and hot.
